## Introduction

This bot may be useful in a cybersecurity training or awareness program, where users can be exposed to various cybersecurity scenarios and learn how to prevent or respond to them. By using a Discord bot, the scenarios can be easily shared with users in a server environment, and the bot can be customized to include additional commands or functionality as needed. Additionally, the bot can be run in a Docker container, making it easy to deploy and manage in various environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### How to run:
#### Python:
Assuming you are using a Unix-based system, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the bot.py script is located. Then, run the following command:
```bash
export BOT_TOKEN="INSERT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"
export GUILD_ID="INSERT YOUR GUILD ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes and leaderboard)"
export LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR LEADERBOARD CHANNEL ID HERE (Only needed for leaderboard for prompts)" 
export CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR CHANNEL ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
export APLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR A+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
export NETPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR Network+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
export SECPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR Security+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
export QUIZROLE="INSERT YOUR QUIZ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
python bot.py
```
Note that if you are using a Windows-based system, you'll need to use a slightly different command to set the environment variable. Here's an example command that should work on Windows:
```shell
set BOT_TOKEN="INSERT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE"
set GUILD_ID="INSERT YOUR GUILD ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
set LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR LEADERBOARD CHANNEL ID HERE (Only needed for leaderboard for prompts)" 
set LEADERBOARD_PERSIST_CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR LEADERBOARD PERSIST CHANNEL ID HERE (Only needed for leaderboard for prompts)" 
set CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR CHANNEL ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
set APLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR A+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
set NETPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR Network+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
set SECPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR Security+ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
set QUIZROLE="INSERT YOUR QUIZ ROLE ID HERE (only needed for timed quizes)"
python bot.py
```
#### Docker:
When running the Docker container, you can pass in the BOT_TOKEN environment variable using the -e flag as follows:

```bash
docker run -e BOT_TOKEN="INSERT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE" -it --rm simeononsecurity/discord-cyber-scenario-bot:latest
```

To run the bot in the background:
```bash
docker run -td --name scenario-bot -e BOT_TOKEN="INSERT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE" simeononsecurity/discord-cyber-scenario-bot:latest
```

To run the bot in the background with all scheduled prompts and roles:
```bash
docker run -td --name scenario-bot \
-e BOT_TOKEN="INSERT YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE" \
-e GUILD_ID="INSERT YOUR GUILD ID HERE" \
-e LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR LEADERBOARD CHANNEL ID HERE" \
-e LEADERBOARD_PERSIST_CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR LEADERBOARD PERSIST CHANNEL ID HERE" \
-e CHANNEL_ID="INSERT YOUR CHANNEL ID HERE" \
-e APLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR A+ ROLE ID HERE" \
-e NETPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR NET+ ROLE ID HERE" \
-e SECPLUSROLE="INSERT YOUR SEC+ ROLE ID HERE" \
-e QUIZROLE="INSERT YOUR QUIZ ROLE ID HERE" \
simeononsecurity/discord-cyber-scenario-bot:latest
```

## Usage

The CyberScenarioBot offers various commands and features to enhance your cybersecurity training and awareness program. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Quizzes and Scenarios**: Use the `/quiz` command to get a random cybersecurity awareness question. Use commands like `/aplus`, `/netplus`, `/secplus` to access specific prompts related to CompTIA certifications. Use commands like `/bluescenario` and `/redscenario` to get blue team and red team scenarios, respectively.

2. **Leaderboard**: Keep track of user progress and compare scores with others in your server by answering the quiz and certification questions.

3. **Tool Commands**: Utilize various tool commands to perform tasks related to DNS, hashing, ping, phone number lookup, Shodan IP search, subnet calculations, and domain WHOIS lookup. Use commands like `/dns`, `/hash`, `/ping`, `/phonelookup`, `/shodanip`, `/subnet`, and `/whois` followed by the appropriate arguments.

4. **Informational Commands**: Use the `/commands` command to get a list of available commands. Use the `/socials` command to get information about the bot's social media accounts and websites.
