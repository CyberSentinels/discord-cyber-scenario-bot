        },
        "correctanswer": "c",
        "reasoning": "A key exchange algorithm is an algorithm used to establish a shared secret key between two parties, without transmitting the key over an insecure channel. This can be used to facilitate secure communication using symmetric encryption algorithms.",

        "question": "What is a public key infrastructure (PKI)?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "A system used to manage user access to resources",
            "b": "A system used to establish secure communication between two parties",
            "c": "A system used to verify the identity of a person or entity",
            "d": "A system used to manage public and private keys for encryption and decryption",
        },
        "correctanswer": "d",
        "reasoning": "A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a system used to manage public and private keys for encryption and decryption. This can include a certificate authority to issue and manage digital certificates, a registration authority to verify the identity of certificate holders, and a certificate revocation list to manage revoked or expired certificates.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a digital certificate?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "A digital document used to verify the identity of a person or entity",
            "b": "A digital document used to encrypt messages",

            "d": "A digital document used to decrypt messages",
        },
        "correctanswer": "a",
        "reasoning": "A digital certificate is a digital document used to verify the identity of a person or entity, such as a website or organization. It typically contains information such as the owner's name and public key, and is issued by a trusted third party known as a certificate authority.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a key pair?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "Two symmetric keys used for encryption and decryption",
            "b": "Two asymmetric keys used for encryption and decryption",
            "c": "Two public keys used for encryption and decryption",
            "d": "Two private keys used for encryption and decryption",
        },
        "correctanswer": "b",
        "reasoning": "A key pair is two asymmetric keys used for encryption and decryption, consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared freely, while the private key must be kept secret to ensure secure communication.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a certificate signing request (CSR)?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "A request to revoke a digital certificate",
            "b": "A request to issue a digital certificate",
            "c": "A request to encrypt a message",
            "d": "A request to decrypt a message",
        },
        "correctanswer": "b",
        "reasoning": "A certificate signing request (CSR) is a request to issue a digital certificate, typically containing information about the certificate requester such as their name and public key. This request is signed with the requester's private key, and can be sent to a certificate authority for verification and issuance of a digital certificate.",
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a digital envelope?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "A container used to store digital certificates",
            "b": "A container used to store public keys",
            "c": "A container used to store private keys",
            "d": "A container used to encrypt messages",
        },
        "correctanswer": "d",
        "reasoning": "A digital envelope is a container used to encrypt messages using a symmetric encryption algorithm, such as AES. The contents of the message are encrypted with a random symmetric key, which is then encrypted using the recipient's public key. The encrypted symmetric key and encrypted message are sent together in the digital envelope, which can only be decrypted by the recipient using their private key.",

        "question": "What is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "An attack that intercepts and modifies communication between two parties",
            "b": "An attack that brute forces encryption keys",
            "c": "An attack that leaks sensitive information to unauthorized parties",
            "d": "An attack that crashes a system or network",
        },
        "correctanswer": "a",
        "reasoning": "A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is an attack that intercepts and modifies communication between two parties, such as by eavesdropping on a wireless network or by compromising a network router. This can allow the attacker to read, modify, or inject messages, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the communication.",
